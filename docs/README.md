<h2 id="introduction">🌟 Introduction</h2>

This repository demonstrates the use of C# Interface through a simple console application. In this repository, interfaces are used to specify capabilities for creatures such as attacking or taking damage. By using interfaces, different classes can adhere to a common contract, ensuring they implement the same set of methods and properties, which makes the code more modular, maintainable, and scalable by allowing new classes to integrate seamlessly without altering the existing code.
